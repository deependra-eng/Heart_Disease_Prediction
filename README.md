# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Project Overview : Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for patients. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health metrics and lifestyle factors.

Data Sources: Data was collected from the Kaggle.

Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, SK-learn (ML Models : Logistic regression, SVC, Decision tree classifier, GaussianNB)

EDA Observations:
>>There are no null vales present in dataset.
>>There are no class imbalancing in Target variable.
>>50% of the people coming from age between 47 and 61.

Data Modeling: We have built different Predictive models like Logistic regression(Accuracy = 0.80), Support Vector Classifier(Accuracy = 0.65), GaussianNB(Accuracy = 0.81), Decision Tree Classifier(Accuracy = 0.68).Both model Logictic anf GaussianNB have almost same accuracy.

Model Selection : We are going ahead with Logistic regression model, beacuse its better choice due to its similar accuracy and simpler, more interpretable nature.
